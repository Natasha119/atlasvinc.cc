## The website itself
- I get too many people asking me on the streets, "What does your website actually do?" or, "What are you putting on your website?" or, "Who cares?"  
- Not many really care about projects like this and I'm perfectly okay with that.  
- I'm creating this website/series of websites as a way to get myself to try different stuff and to expand how I think with programming/computers.  
- I don't really want to make any of my sites too flashy or anything because I'm trying to imitate the early internet style of mostly-plaintext webpages/blogs/chatrooms/other miscellaneous oddities because I think the modern internet is sorely lacking such things nowadays, and I want to at least say, "Yeah, I tried to uphold something good."  
- Development will likely be infrequent but... well, at least it's something. I'm also trying to make the code as simple and as legible as possible becuase, I like that. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. I'm also trying to challenge myself a bit by using only libraries included in NodeJS or... I don't know, maybe I'll switch languages entirely some day and use C# as the backend. Poin it, base libraries wherever possible... except for when it's kind of not. See DEVLOG 23:28 2024-01-31.
 
## Purpose
- Idiot-proofing the code from yours-truly  
- Provide myself with accountability to develop the project, on account of, it my be in the public eye  
- Flex the fact that I have my own website to my friends and family
