			<h1>You've landed on my website. Hello.</h1>
			<hr />
			<p> You'll find new stuff here sometimes. Not really... <br />It's more like whenever I feel like it once in a blue moon. <br /> So here, Traveller, have a little quote from a song that I like. </p>
			<blockquote> 
				...<br />
				What happens when life breaks down<br />
				When there is systemic contradiction?<br />
				My name symbolized all that was corrupt to society<br />
				His name symbolized all that was pure<br />
				And I was being held in the embrace of a man who was pure<br />
				And these inviolable sanctities were preserved in those ten words<br />
				And it is the de-sacralization of all of these<br />
				That has put us in the mess that we find ourselves<br />
				Isn't it true, alas it is much worse<br />
				A person may end up believing in anything<br />
				Think of what it is when God himself puts his arms around you and says "Welcome home"<br />
				...

			<h2>The machine under the hood</h2>
			<p> You're currently connected to a <em>Dell PowerEdge R720</em> which sits in my room, maybe under my bed, maybe beside my dresser. <br /> There's not much to say about the machine itself... specs-wise it's fairly standard.

			<h2>What is ATLASVINC and who is Natasha119?</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>ATLASVINC is, simply put, a dumb fantasy organization that I created as part of a fantasy game when I was a small child.</li>
				<li>Me. I used Natasha as a name for my roleplay characters on the internet. I don't remember where the 119 part came from. I use the name now for anonymity, but really, I think my real name, James B., suits me better.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>What can be found here?</h2>
			<p> Great question. Not much. But I suppose if you have the credentials, you could access my <a href="https://nextcloud.atlasvinc.cc">Nextcloud</a> instance. <br /> There's also a barely-used but soon-to-not-be-barely-used <a href="jellyfin.atlasvinc.cc">Jellyfin</a> instance running here too. <br /> In the backend of things there's a Windows Server VM which hosts an Active Directory server and hosts the SMB shares for the 8TB disk array, and a Lab VM which is dispensible for new projects/concepts. <sub>Whenever those come along, heh.</sub>
			</p>
			<h2>What <em>is</em> in progress, then? </h2>
			<p> Currently being <em>planned</em>:
			<ul>
				<li>Mass DVD ripping through... something. Server DVD drives... old MacBooks maybe?</li>
				<li>Small chat application. This page was <em>supposed</em> to be the frontpage for that... but I decided to make a landing page for both domains. </li>
				<li>Mail server. Imagine how cool that would be, "Oh yeah, just contact me <em>here</em> at <em>my</em> website running software that <em>I</em> chose for it. Take that, gmail users... oh... </li>
				<li>Generic file server and maybe a git server. Nextcloud is... kinda slow.</li>
			</ul>
			<br /> Currently in <em>in progress</em>: <ul>
				<li>No :)</li>
			</ul>
